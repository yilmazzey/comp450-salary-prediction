real-world problem. So, I chose to analyze the 2024
Stack Overflow Developer Survey and see if I could
predict how much developers earn based on their
background, education, and job type.
In this post, I’ll walk you through everything I did :
from cleaning messy survey data to building
models and interpreting results using SHAP. Along
the way, I learned just how complex salary
prediction really is.
Project Goals
My main goal was to build a predictive model that
estimates annual compensation and explain how
key variables affect predictions.
- Build a predictive regression model
- Tune and evaluate performance
- Interpret the results using SHAP to explain which
features influenced salary most.
The goal was to follow a complete data science
process: cleaning and preprocessing real-world
data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA),
building regression models, tuning them, and
interpreting their outputs using SHAP.

Dataset Overview

The dataset had 65,000+ survey responses across
114 columns.
But many of the columns were:
free text (hard to use in modeling)
Multiple-choice questions with messy
formatting
Mostly empty or not useful for predicting
salary
So instead of using all 114 columns, I selected a
subset of structured, relevant variables that were:
Easy to work with
Likely to affect salary
Mostly filled in by respondents
I focused on the following columns:
Country – where the developer lives
EdLevel – their highest education level
YearsCode – how many years they’ve been

coding
Employment – whether they’re full-time, student,

etc.

DevType – what kind of developer they are

My target variable was:
ConvertedCompYearly : self-reported salary

converted to USD.
After filtering for non-null salary values and
cleaning text-based entries, the working dataset
was reduced to ~23,000 valid observations.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Before modeling, I want to explore the following
questions using visual analysis :
1. What were the most important factors that
influenced a developer’s salary?
2. How does salary vary across different
education levels, countries, and job types?
3. Can I build a machine learning model to
predict a developer’s salary based on their
background and work profile?
The next step was to perform some visual EDA
(exploratory data analysis) to look for trends and
patterns in the data.
Salary Distribution

The distribution was highly right-skewed, most
salaries fell below $200,000, with a small number
of very high earners pulling the tail to the right.
This skewness is typical in real-world income data,
where a few individuals earn significantly more
than the average.
This plot confirmed the need for using models
that can handle non-linear relationships or skewed
distributions.
Education Level and Salary

As expected, those with advanced degrees such as
Master’s or Doctoral degrees generally reported
higher average salaries. Interestingly, some groups
like professional degree holders and even those
with “some college” experience showed higher
earnings. This may reflect other factors like job
type, skills, or years of experience.
Overall, this confirmed that EdLevel is an
important feature for our salary prediction model.
Years of Experience vs. Salary

I expected to see a strong link between experience
and salary, but the plot showed a lot of variation.
Some developers with just a few years of
experience earned very high salaries, while others
with decades of experience earned much less.
This tells me that experience alone doesn’t explain

salary well. That’s why I chose to use models like
decision trees and random forests. These models
can handle complex patterns.

Modeling Approaches
Linear Regression
To start, I used a simple linear regression model.
This gave me a baseline to compare other models
against. Linear regression assumes a straight-line
relationship between features and the target.
After training and testing, I planned to compare
the model’s error and R² score to see how well it
performs.

# Step 1: Split Target and Features Matrix
y= df_encoded['ConvertedCompYearly'] #set target variable
X= df_encoded.drop('ConvertedCompYearly', axis=1)

# Step 2: Train Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test= train_test_split(X,y, te
# Step 3: Train Linear Regression Model
lr_model= LinearRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Step 4: Predict Linear Regression Model
train_lr_pred = lr_model.predict(X_train)
train_lr_r2= lr_model.score(X_train, y_train)
print(f'Linear Model training r^2: {train_lr_r2:.3f}')
train_lr_rmse= root_mean_squared_error(y_train, train_lr_p
print(f'Linear Model training RMSE: {train_rmse:.2f}')
test_lr_pred= lr_model.predict(X_test)
test_lr_r2= lr_model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Linear Model test r^2:{test_lr_r2:.3f}')

21.11.2025 17:57

test_lr_rmse= root_mean_squared_error(y_test, test_lr_pred
print(f'Linear Model test RMSE: {test_lr_rmse:.2f}')

I trained a linear regression model to predict
salary using the features I selected. The model’s
performance was quite weak:
- R² Score (Train): 0.107
- R² Score (Test): 0.127
- RMSE (Train): ~$189,000
- RMSE (Test): ~$108,000
This means the model was only explaining about
10–13% of the variation in salaries — and the
prediction error(RMSE) was very high.
Linear regression failed to capture complexity or
non-linear interactions.
Next Step: Trying Tree-Based Models
To improve performance, I tried tree based models
to capture non-linear relationships and noisy data
like Salary.
Decision Tree Regressor
Train R²: 0.955
Test R²: -1.093

21.11.2025 17:57

RMSE (Test) : $167,672
The test results were poor:
The R² score was negative, meaning the model
did worse than simply predicting the average
salary for everyone.
The test RMSE was over $167,000, indicating
very large errors on new data.
This confirmed that the model was overfitting ; it
performs well on the training set but failed to
generalize to unseen data.
Random Forest Regressor (Untuned)
Train R²: 0.810
Test R²: -0.236
RMSE (Test) : $128,836
Random Forest reduced overfitting but still
generalized poorly on the test set.

Feature Selection and Model Tuning
Using feature_importances_ from the Random
Forest model, I selected the top 10 most impactful
features.

21.11.2025 17:57

I retrained a Random Forest model using only
these top 10 features and ran GridSearchCV to
tune hyperparameters.
Final Model (Tuned Random Forest on Top 10
Features)

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
'max_depth': [15,20, 25],
'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
}
#Set Up the grid search
grid_search_model=GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestRegre
param_grid=param_grid,
scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_er
grid_search_model.fit(X_train_top, y_train) # Fit on train
#View Best Parameters
print("Best Parameters:", grid_search_model.best_params_)
best_model= grid_search_model.best_estimator_

# Predict Best Model
train_best_pred= best_model.predict(X_train_top)
train_best_r2= best_model.score(X_train_top, y_train)
train_best_rmse= root_mean_squared_error(y_train, train_be
test_best_pred= best_model.predict(X_test_top)

21.11.2025 17:57

test_best_r2= best_model.score(X_test_top, y_test)
test_best_rmse= root_mean_squared_error(y_test, test_best_
print(f"Train R^2: {train_best_r2:.3f}")
print(f"Train RMSE: {train_best_rmse:.3f}")
print(f"Test R^2: {test_best_r2:.3f}")
print(f"Test RMSE: {test_best_rmse:.3f}")

Train R²: 0.188
Test R²: 0.045
Test RMSE: ~113,000 USD
Despite tuning, the model showed limited ability
to generalize. The predicted salaries remained far
from actual values across most test samples.

Why Performance Was Low
Even after tuning, my best model explained less
than 20% of the salary variation. Why?
Salary data is noisy and self-reported
The dataset lacks details like company size,
bonus structure, and job titles
Some factors like negotiation skill or market
conditions aren’t captured in surveys
So I shifted focus from accuracy to
interpretability.

21.11.2025 17:57

SHAP for Interpretability
I used SHAP to interpret the trained model and
understand which features had the greatest impact
on salary predictions:

import shap

# Explain model predictions
explainer = shap.Explainer(best_model, X_train_top) #creat
shap_values = explainer(X_train_top) #compute SHAP for tra

# Visualize global feature importance
shap.plots.bar(shap_values) # plot overall importance of f

Key observations:
Developers in the United States had the
strongest positive influence on salary
predictions.
More years of experience correlated with
higher predictions.

21.11.2025 17:57

Executive and managerial developer types
increased predicted compensation.
SHAP confirmed that the model prioritized
location, experience, and role type.

Conclusions
1. Does education level significantly affect a
developer’s salary?
Insight: Yes , developers with higher degrees
(Master’s, PhD, Professional) generally earn more.
However, there are notable exceptions where
developers with lower formal education (e.g. selftaught) still report high salaries.
2. Is there a strong correlation between years of
experience and salary?
Insight: A weak positive trend exists, but it’s not
linear. Some developers with very little experience
report high salaries, and vice versa. This suggests
that experience alone is not a strong predictor.
3. Which countries are associated with higher
average salaries?
Insight: The United States consistently ranks at the
top, followed by certain countries in Europe.
Country was the most influential feature in the
SHAP analysis.
4. What developer roles (DevType) are linked to

higher compensation?
Insight: Executive-level roles (e.g. C-Suite, VP,
Director) and specialized roles (e.g. Project
Manager) had higher predicted salaries compared
to general developer titles.
5. Which features have the highest predictive
power for salary?
Insight: Based on SHAP values and feature
importance from Random Forest, the top
predictors were:
Country
YearsCode
DevType
EdLevel

Salary prediction in this context proved highly
challenging due to:
High variance in self-reported salary data
Lack of features like company size, job title,
industry, or bonus structures
Non-normalized comparisons across countries
with different economic standards. I chose not
to normalize salary values across countries or
apply cost-of-living adjustments because the
dataset lacked reliable reference baselines (e.g.
average country salaries, regional indices).
